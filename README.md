2022-2023 Build Season Robot Code updated to 2024

To run this robot in 2024 demos (since the RIO has the 2024 firmware) do the following:

* Using Phoenix tuner, set all the CTRE device firmware (Pigeon and CanCoders) to Phoenix 5
* Set CanCoder for Right Rear sensor direction OFF
* Code was developed in (and merged from) the CodeFor2024_Ryan branch
